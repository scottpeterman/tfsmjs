## Features That Might Need Attention

1. **Error Handling with Messages**:
   - The Python version allows passing error messages via the "Error" line operator, e.g., `-> Error "Custom message"`
   - These are passed through to the exception message in the Python version

2. **Double-quoted State Names**:
   - The Python code supports state names in quotes, as seen in `NEWSTATE_RE = r'(?P<new_state>\w+|".*")'`
   - This allows for error messages or other non-alphanumeric content

3. **Handling of Empty EOF and End States**:
   - The validation prevents non-empty EOF and End states
   - Empty states are treated specially at runtime

4. **Options Validation Extensibility**:
   - The `_ValidateOptions` method is designed to be extended by subclasses
   - Your implementation has this foundation but might need specific extensions

5. **Nested Group Handling in List Values**:
   - The Python implementation has special handling for nested regex groups in List values
   - This enables complex capture patterns like `Value List ((?P<name>\w+)\s+(?P<age>\d+))`

6. **Fillup Option Behavior**:
   - The Fillup option applies values upward through previous records
   - This requires careful backfilling of previously stored records

7. **Encoding Compatibility**:
   - Python handles various text encodings with its decode methods
   - Your JavaScript implementation should handle UTF-8 and other encodings

8. **State Transition Edge Cases**:
   - Pay special attention to EOF transitions and error state handling
   - Python has specific edge case handling for state transitions

## Implementation Details to Review

1. **Regex Engine Differences**:
   - JavaScript's regex engine has subtle differences from Python's
   - Watch for issues with lookaheads, lookbehinds, and character classes

2. **String Template Substitution**:
   - The Python code uses `string.Template` for variable substitution
   - Your regex-based approach is good but verify it handles all edge cases

3. **Named Capture Groups**:
   - Make sure your conversion from Python's `(?P<name>pattern)` to JavaScript's `(?<name>pattern)` is robust
   - This is critical for both rule matching and nested group handling
